Installng Linux The easy way on Samsung (assuming you want an Ubuntu LTS with Xfce)

1) Download crouton

2) Open a shell (Ctrl+Alt+T, type shell and hit enter)

3) Copy the installer to an executable location by running 

4) sudo install -Dt /usr/local/bin -m 755 ~/Downloads/crouton

5) Now that it's executable, run the installer itself:

6) sudo /usr/local/bin/crouton -r xenial -t core

7) Next you have to enter-chroot and install the xserver with the following commands:

8) sudo sh enter-chroot

9) sudo apt install xserver-xorg-core xserver-xorg-video-dummy xdiagnose

10) exit

11) Optonal : Add 'xiwi' or any other target to an existing chroot with the -u option:

12) sudo sh /usr/local/bin/crouton -t xiwi -u -r xenial

13) If you want to keep the 'xorg' xmethod as the default then pick it first:

14) sudo sh /usr/local/bin/crouton -t xorg,xiwi -u -n xenial

15) Finally execute this step to update the xenial install with xfce:

16) sudo sh /usr/local/bin/crouton -u -t xfce -n xenial
